Our epic handles the Github integration side of Mapache Search, such as getting user data 
from Github to display on the site

# Observations

I was not able to get the search working, it would just redirect to an error page.
Other than that I feel like the UI could be improved by adding icons, and displaying text on the homepage
that described what Mapache Search does.
